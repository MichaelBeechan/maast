% Keep this file in the git root directory

% Note: This file only adds the maast tools to the path. Most maast
% functions require the stanford-gnss-tool which can be found at:
% https://github.com/stanford-gps-lab/stanford-gnss-tools
%
% Once you have downloaded this set of code to a separate directory, use
% the addPathScript associated with that code base to add those tools to
% the path as well.
